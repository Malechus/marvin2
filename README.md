# Multiple Application, Resource Variable Information Node  
### Or you can call me M.A.R.V.I.N., I guess.  

The goal of this application is to tie together multiple home automation systems, self hosted software packages, and home based data tracking. I'm starting with tracking chores for the family via a Discord bot using [Discord.net](https://docs.discordnet.dev/index.html) and some data aggregation from my self hosted Pi-Hole using the [Pi-Hole api.](https://docs.pi-hole.net/api/)  

An update of the [original marvin Discord bot,](https://github.com/Malechus/marvin) this suite includes a web interface and expanded features.
